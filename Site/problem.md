Project Problem Statement Rough Draft


Problem: Exercising is one of the best ways to stay in shape. Many people struggle to exercise regularly due to several factors such as, gym membership costs, lack of time, motivation, etc.

The goal of our website is to create a simple to use workout generator, that will allow the user to input various settings and receive back a workout routine that they could use either at the gym or at home to begin their workout journey. We want it to be simple to use and understand, and to generate a doable, customizable workout, along with various features such as a calendar to help the user to keep track of their workouts. For now, the intention is simply to have it generate a workout, and have a calender. However, if we get this done early, we might also add additional features.

Consequences: Figuring out the best way to exercise can be a sea of information and it’s easy to get lost before getting started. Not exercising can be the cause of health problems in the long-term. Starting a new habit is easy when motivation is high, however motivation usually only lasts a few weeks and this is when habits begin to fail. 

Solution: In this project, we aim to create a workout application which will reduce the friction associated with exercising regularly. 

Things that it does: 
This workout app will maintain track of how many workouts you have completed. It will have a calendar feature which will display the current month with checkmarks on days completed. 
This workout app will implement a progressive overload system which automatically increases the user’s weight by 2.5lbs or 5 lbs every workout. 
This workout app will implement a random workout generator for users who do not have access to a gym, in this case, the user will be asked to decide exactly when they will start working out during the day. (right after work, right after school, right after getting home from XYZ), this app will implement a push notification to remind the user with a customizable message, such as “Workout begins in 5 minutes, change into your gym attire”. The random workout generator will allow the user to view a model of the human body and be able to select a muscle group they wish to exercise. Once a muscle group is selected, the user will be able to view a list of exercises which target it. 


The workout generator will be in the form of a website, where the user can print out or write down the workout that they want to bring to the gym with them. However, if we have time, we will implement all of these features in the form of an app. The website will be created using HTML and CSS, and the generation features will be done with Java. Some JavaScript might also be used. We will also aim to make the website responsive so that it will scale to fit on smaller screens.
