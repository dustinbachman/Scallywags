Project Problem Statement Rough Draft <br>


<br>Problem: Exercising is one of the best ways to stay in shape. Many people struggle to exercise regularly due to several <br>factors such as, gym membership costs, lack of time, motivation, etc. <br>

<br>The goal of our website is to create a simple to use workout generator, that will allow the user to input various settings <br>and receive back a workout routine that they could use either at the gym or at home to begin their workout journey. We want <br>it to be simple to use and understand, and to generate a doable, customizable workout, along with various features such as a <br>calendar to help the user to keep track of their workouts. For now, the intention is simply to have it generate a workout, <br>and have a calender. However, if we get this done early, we might also add additional features.

<br><br>Consequences: Figuring out the best way to exercise can be a sea of information and it’s easy to get lost before getting <br>started. Not exercising can be the cause of health problems in the long-term. Starting a new habit is easy when motivation <br>is high, however motivation usually only lasts a few weeks and this is when habits begin to fail. 

<br>Solution: In this project, we aim to create a workout application which will reduce the friction associated with exercising <br>regularly. 

<br><br>Things that it does: 
<br>This workout app will maintain track of how many workouts you have completed. It will have a calendar feature which will <br>display the current month with checkmarks on days completed. 
<br>This workout app will implement a progressive overload system which automatically increases the user’s weight by 2.5lbs or 5 <br>lbs every workout. 
<br><br>This workout app will implement a random workout generator for users who do not have access to a gym, in this case, the <br>user will be asked to decide exactly when they will start working out during the day. (right after work, right after school, <br>right after getting home from XYZ), this app will implement a push notification to remind the user with a customizable <br>message, such as “Workout begins in 5 minutes, change into your gym attire”. The random workout generator will allow the <br>user to view a model of the human body and be able to select a muscle group they wish to exercise. Once a muscle group is <br>selected, the user will be able to view a list of exercises which target it. 


<br><br>The workout generator will be in the form of a website, where the user can print out or write down the workout that they <br>want to bring to the gym with them. However, if we have time, we will implement all of these features in the form of an app. <br>The website will be created using HTML and CSS, and the generation features will be done with Java. Some JavaScript might <br>also be used. We will also aim to make the website responsive so that it will scale to fit on smaller screens.
