1.1: Workout History to Calendar Tracker Feature
</br>

As a user, I want to see a visual representation of my workout history, so that I can keep track of my workout habits. </br></br>
Elaboration: Users should have the ability to keep track of their workout history so we need a feature which allows that. Since calendars are already a great visual representation of habits we will use one to achieve this.  </br></br>

Constraints: none</br></br>

Effort Estimation: 3 person-hours</br></br>

Acceptance Test: Perform a randomly generated workout with at least three working sets. Show that once the workout has been marked as complete, that day on the calendar will be highlighted with a bubble to represent it as complete.</br></br>

End of Semester Update: This is partially implemented. Events can be added to the calendar, but not automatically. The automatic implementation is marked as future work.</br></br></br></br>


1.2: Progressive Overload Feature</br>
As a user, I want to see that I’m improving every time that I do a workout, so that I can keep making progress towards my fitness goals.</br></br>
Elaboration: Users should have the ability to keep track of their previous workout stats, so that they can try to improve a little bit next time. Since progressive overload is widely regarded as one of the most fundamental tools to build muscle in the sports science community, 
</br>we need a feature that will keep track of previous workout history sets/reps and will implement progressive overload by slightly increasing the difficulty of the next workout in the form of a greater weight (2.5/5.0 lbs +) or by increasing the volume of an exercise(35 total push-ups instead of total 30 push-ups).  
</br></br>
Constraints: none</br></br>

Effort Estimation: 5 person-hours</br></br>

Acceptance Test: Given a previous workout’s stats, perform a new workout session with exactly the same exercises. Show that the app has automatically increased the difficulty of the current workout by comparing the current difficulty to the previous workout’s difficulty.</br></br>

End of Semester Update: This is future work. We did not get around to being able to store users and their previous workouts.</br></br></br></br>


1.3: Random Workout Generator Feature</br>
As a user, I may not always have access to a gym and I want to be able to workout anywhere with or without equipment.  </br></br>
Elaboration: Users should have the ability to decide whether they want to work out at a gym, at home, or even somewhere else. Some people may not always have access to all types of equipment so there needs to be an option to select what type of 
</br>equipment is currently available to the user. This can be used to generate a workout for the user based on their workout requests and their specific type of equipment that they want to use. </br></br>

Constraints: none</br></br>

Effort Estimation: 6 person-hours</br></br>

Acceptance Test: Given a list of equipment available, generate a new workout based around those pieces of equipment and the other options that the user has inputted, such as number of sets and which muscles will be worked out. </br></br>

End of Semester Update: This is partially implemented. The random workout generator works but only takes dumbbells into account. Getting user input for equipment is future work.</br></br></br></br>


1.4: Tutorial Feature </br>
As a user, I want to make sure that I am performing a workout correctly.</br></br>
Elaboration: Users should see a small tutorial to make sure that they are performing the workout correctly. If a user is performing a workout incorrectly, it could damage their muscles instead of helping to strengthen them.</br></br>

Constraints: Finding tutorials that aren't copyrighted(?) or making tutorials.</br></br>

Effort Estimation: 3 person-hours. </br></br>

Acceptance Test: For every workout that is possible to get on the site, there is a small tutorial that teaches the user the correct way to perform that workout. </br></br>

End of Semester Update: This is fully implemented. The user currently sees a gif that teaches them the correct way to perform the workout.</br></br></br></br>


1.5: Timer </br>
As a user, I want to be able to keep track of my time spent doing each set. </br></br>
Elaboration: The user should be told how long to do each set and they should be displayed a timer which helps them keep track of how long they've spent on a set and how much longer they have to go. </br></br>

Constraints: None</br></br>

Effort Estimation: 4 person-hours</br></br>

Acceptance Test: Each workout given to the user should come with a timer that they can watch to see how long they still have to go in their current set. </br></br>

End of Semester Update: This is implemented. The user can choose between 30, 45, 60, and 90 second timers.</br></br></br></br>

1.6: Workout Increase</br>
As a user, I want to be able to get stronger at my own speed. </br></br>
Elaboration: Users should be able to rate how easy their workout was after each workout and the app would then decide whether or not they need to increase their amount of reps or weight next time.</br></br>

Constraints: None </br></br>

Effort Estimation: 6 person-hours</br></br>

Acceptance Test: A user should be able to tell the app how difficult they last workout was and the app should make the decision on whether or not to change their workout next time.</br></br>

End of Semester Update: This is future work. We currently do not have a way to store users and their data so we can not increase user's workouts based on previous workouts.</br></br></br></br>

1.7: Different types of Workout</br>
As a user, I want to be able to do different workouts without it being reptitive and can target different muscle groups of my body. That way I don't have to look up different workouts for arm day, leg day, chest day, etc. and not have it be the same thing and stale out after a while. </br></br>

Elaboration: The users should be able to use the website as a reliable source to get different workouts so they can feel motivated to continue on this pattern in their lives. So, a database would be needed to account different workout plans containing different exeercises. </br></br>

Constraints: Accessing a server to manage </br></br>

Effort Estimation: 8 person-hours</br></br>

Acceptance Test: The user should not get the same workout two workouts in a row. </br></br>

End of Semester Update: This is future work. We need to be able to store user data to see their previous workouts, which we do not currently have implemented.</br>
