future it'll be tested out <br><br>

2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies <br>
Does your system depend on external software packages? System assumptions? If so, describe them. <br>
* We'll depend on a small server specifically the mySQL workbench to keep our database aspect up and running until we find a better optimal solution especially since this is a new <br>
playing field for a lot of us and will be something to solve in case this doesn't work exactly <br>
