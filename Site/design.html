1. Describe the design of your system <br> <br>

The design of our system implements a workout generator which will allow the user to enter a custom workout, this includes which muscles to target, how many workouts per muscle group, how long per set, how many sets, and how often per week. Once a workout has begun, the first set will include instructions on how to perform the exercise along with a timer and the ability to move on to the next set. The user will have the ability to enter the workout they have completed into the calendar.

2. Architecture <br> <br>

Our architecture is the Event-Driven Architecture. <br>
An event-driven architecture uses events to trigger and communicate between decoupled services, meaning that each selection of user input creates an event. <br>
These events are then sent to the driver program and used to generate a workout routine from a database, which is then sent back to the user. <br>

3. Classes <br> <br>

There is one main driver class in our program, and a selection of corresponding HTML pages that are displayed. <br>
The driver program is what selects which workout to display, corresponding with the user's input given in the index.html page. <br>
The page contains code to display the timer counting down, show the workout as well as an image of what the user is supposed to be doing, and remaining sets. <br> <br>

4. Threading and control <br> <br>

The program will, once completed, have the user begin at the index.html page, and take input from each of the segments allowing for user input. <br>
Each of these will produce a value, and each value will then be used to create a workout routine, done using the driving JavaScript code. <br>
Each segment is connected, either through built in HTML features, or through alternative methods not yet implemented <br>
