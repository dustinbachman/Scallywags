# Brief description:
The purpose of our product is to have a free use of service for people to use and get inspired to workout and get motivated to have a good healthy balance in life. The main idea of this product is to have a website in which someone can have a scheduled structured gym set of workouts that anybody could use either they're a beginner, intermediate, expert working out. It contains a calendar functionality to keep track of the number of times someone logs in and goes through the process as well as have a reminder system to remind someone to get their workout in either by text messaging or email notification.
